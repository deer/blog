Mayday mayday, we're going in the wrong direction. I guess my goal for tomorrow is to start before 10pm.

# Guide to Yesterday
Well, given that I didn't do anything yesterday, there's not much to say here, now is there?

# Today's Result
So if you're reading this you can see that there's some new links: my primitive attempt at a navbar. For posterity, I'll include the screenshots of today's progress again:

![The home page](../screenshots/2023-01-19/index.jpg)
![A particular post](../screenshots/2023-01-19/post.jpg)

This will be fun to look back at once I learn more about react.


# Plan for Tomorrow
Make it less fugly.
