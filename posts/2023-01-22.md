title: Forking an open source project

So this template for posts is somehow hampering my creative freedom. Or something like that. I guess more accurately I don't want to have to fill out some sheet every day. That feels a bit too much like a TPS report.

Instead, we'll try something a bit more free form and throw caution to the wind. Who knows what I did yesterday or how it was done!

Today I managed to [fork](https://github.com/deer/fresh/tree/modify_app_props) the Fresh repository in order to incorporate this [fix](https://github.com/denoland/fresh/pull/599). Why would I do such a thing? Well, check out one of the (currently) useless pages on the site before the change:
![before](../screenshots/2023-01-21/about.jpg)
and after:
![after](../screenshots/2023-01-22/about.jpg)

This is not terribly exciting, other than it allows me to use Fresh's undocumented `_app.tsx` to provide a template to the blog, but also pass information to it about the current route.

## Referencing an unpublished module from `import_map.json`
Previously my import map looked like:
```json
"$fresh/": "https://deno.land/x/fresh@1.1.2/",
```
And now after my change it looks like:
```json
"$fresh/": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deer/fresh/modify_app_props/",
```

But if you go to [https://deno.land/x/fresh@1.1.2/](https://deno.land/x/fresh@1.1.2/) it presents you with some info, whereas if you go to [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deer/fresh/modify_app_props/](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deer/fresh/modify_app_props/) you get a `400` error. How this?

The key thing is to look at the `deno.lock` file which now has entries like:
```json
"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deer/fresh/modify_app_props/dev.ts": "a66c7d64be35bcd6a8e12eec9c27ae335044c70363a241f2e36ee776db468622",
```
and if you were to go to that URL, it is perfectly happy to serve the request.
