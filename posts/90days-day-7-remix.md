I started the Next tutorial, but got a bit sad when I realized it wasn't actually a tutorial to build something. So they have a bunch of documentation and it seems really high quality, but I want to be walked through building something. It seems like their documentation is too much for a busy day, anyway.

I quickly pivoted to [Remix](https://remix.run/). They have a really really nice homepage. If I were creating my own framework, I would want something like this. Apparently Remix is:
> a full stack web framework that lets you focus on the user interface and work back through web standards to deliver a fast, slick, and resilient user experience. People are gonna love using your stuff.

Blah blah blah, "we have the best coolest thing". I don't want convincing; just tell me what the thing is! It's some sort of framework for building apps. A competitor to Next and all the other things.

Right, on to their [docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/tutorials/blog). I like what I see, since they have two tutorials which hold my hand as I build an application. One (the one I did) is "short" and builds a simple blogging engine. The other is "long" (which I haven't done yet, but seriously might, because this one was so nice) and builds some sort of jokes app.

The biggest issue I had with this tutorial is that they're in the midst of refactoring to a new routing convention, and the tutorial is actually broken! Fortunately [this PR](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/5959) already exists with the correction to the docs.

Other than that, I like that they build something I'm familiar with: a blog. When I started work, I had to learn a new technology and functional area (payroll). The hard part? payroll. Don't make the reader learn something new. If it's feasible (and reasonable) to build a blogging system with the framework, the tutorial should just build a blogging system.

They also give me some homework at the end to improve things, which I obviously didn't do. I would perhaps prefer a "tutorial ends here", with some links to optional additions. That way I can keep having my hand held, while being exposed to a bit more. Yeah yeah, tutorial hell, but my point here is to review the experience of onboarding, not to actually learn how the thing works with an intent to use it. Additionally, this is a nice way to see a bunch of different things.

Anyway, great. Remix certainly seems very nice. And their onboarding is good as well.
