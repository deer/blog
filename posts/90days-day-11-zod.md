Welcome back to "90 Day of Tutorials". Today I looked at [Zod](https://zod.dev/). They say:
> Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. I'm using the term "schema" to broadly refer to any data type, from a simple string to a complex nested object.

I first encountered Zod back on [day 5](/blog/90days-day-5-blitz) as I was working with BlitzJS. I was of course intrigued by the library offering an easy way to do runtime type validations. I eventually got around to prioritizing it as part of this project. Sadly the documentation is just... a reference. There's no tutorial or how-to (as per [Diataxis'](https://diataxis.fr/) definition). That's disappointing.

Do not fear! Google to the rescue! A quick search turned up this awesome [resource](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/zod) from [TotalTypescript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/). It's a really fantastic learning portal, where each tutorial is broken down into many exercises. An exercise consists of an introduction, a challenge, and an explanation. Everything is really well done.

If you're looking to learn about Zod, then I can highly recommend what Matt created with TotalTypescript.
