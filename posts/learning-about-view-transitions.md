Today I thought I would share some great articles about view transitions.

- [The View Transitions API And Delightful UI Animations (Part 2)](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/01/view-transitions-api-ui-animations-part2/)
- [Smooth and simple transitions with the View Transitions API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions)

The first two from the fantastic
[Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com) are chock full of code
snippets and interactive examples on code pen. A fantastic way to learn about
view transitions.

The next one is missing the interactive examples, but has plenty of videos
demonstrating what's going on.

If you don't know about the view transitions api, I highly recommend checking it
out. Perhaps you'll even see it on this blog in the future!
