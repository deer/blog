title: Generating a post from a template

Hello from a partially automated post! In the spirit of continued automation, I got tired of creating a new post by hand, which involved a new markdown file and a new folder to hold the screenshots of the blog's status.

Therefore I wrote a small [task](https://deno.land/manual/tools/task_runner) to automate this process. It looks through all the folders I have and finds the most recent one. It then creates a new folder and a new post. I can provide the posts name and it then does everything for me. Sometimes working with comoputers is great.

Here's the template string that I'm currently using:

```ts
const newPostTemplate = `---
title: ${title}
#description: 
date: ${postDate}
---

`;
```

At some point I might get around to using a description, but I haven't found a reason for that yet. Maybe something to do with SEO at some point?

Anyway, that's all folks. A small improvement and a short post!
