# Guide to Yesterday

So this isn't really yesterday, since I didn't do much on Friday the 20th. But I guess that's ok.

What I did on Thursday is a bit embarrassing, because it was so poorly done. I suppose that's part of the learning process.

I wish I could spend a bit more time writing this up, but maybe it's not worth it. Perhaps I can revisit this topic at some point in the future, and do it on my own from scratch.

# Today's Result

Look! It's starting to look like an actual blog! Today's new feature is that it isn't fugly.

# Plan for Tomorrow

Spend some time writing an actual post, talking about the layout. I should include some code samples and such, to make it seem like something actually useful, as opposed to a journal of fails.

The screenshot thing is also getting a bit dull. I really need to automate the process, and come up with a way to show off the history.
