Welcome back to "90 Day of Tutorials". Because I was so impressed with the [Zod tutorial](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/zod) I did [yesterday](/blog/90days-day-11-zod), I decided to check out the [Typescript tutorial](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/beginners-typescript) from the same guy.

It follows the same basic format as his Zod tutorial. I really like this challenge based approach to learning. I would go so far to say that this is the best learning experience I've ever seen. Well done Matt!

I wish there was more free content available, but I suppose creating such quality content takes a lot of time.
