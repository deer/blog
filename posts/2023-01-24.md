I've created another repo, this time with some examples about doing stuff with deno. Check it out [here](https://github.com/deer/deno_examples).

For some reason I wanted to learn about containerizing a simple http server, so I wrote up a small [walkthrough](https://github.com/deer/deno_examples/blob/main/docker/hello_world/README.md) and sample [code](https://github.com/deer/deno_examples/tree/main/docker/hello_world/src).

I made it a bit more complicated by then creating a different [example](https://github.com/deer/deno_examples/tree/main/docker/double_hello_world) that starts two containers, each on a separate port. I'll include the walkthrough here, just for fun:

1. Build everything.
    ```
    docker-compose build
    ```
2. Start the containers.
    ```
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
3. Check to confirm it's serving.
    ```
    curl http://localhost:8081
    ```
    You should see:
    ```
    Hello world from Deno on 8081! ðŸ¦•
    ```
    Check the other server.
    ```
    curl http://localhost:8082
    ```
    You should see:
    ```
    Hello world from Deno on 8082! ðŸ¦•
    ```
4. (Optional) Stop the containers.
   ```
   docker-compose down
   ```

Great, look at me learning!
