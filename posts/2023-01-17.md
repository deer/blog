It's much later than I had wanted it to be, so I guess this one will be a bit shorter than before.

# Guide to Yesterday
I introduced the functionality of taking screenshots of the blog yesterday. So how did I do it?

## Look at Fresh
Again it seems like I'll be looking to others for inspiration (or just straight up taking their code). In this case the [Fresh Showcase](https://fresh.deno.dev/showcase) does exactly what I want. Look at all those great screenshots! And if you go to their source code, you'll eventually make your way to [this file](https://github.com/denoland/fresh/blob/a9e0ba5a26eccc5b31f3169b4d5fbe50bb634488/www/utils/screenshot.ts). (Luca please don't sue me!) Usage is via the command line like:
```
deno task screenshot http://localhost:8000/blog/2023-01-16 post
```
Which is how I took a screenshot of yesterday's post.


## Other Thoughts
Hmmm, other than that there's not a whole lot to report. Obviously a whole bunch of stuff could be added in order to make this easier, but a manual process is fine for now.

Here's the state of the blog, as of yesterday (after I posted):
![The result from yesterday](../screenshots/2023-01-16/index.jpg)
![post](../screenshots/2023-01-16/post.jpg)
Yeah, not a whole lot of change so far.

# Today's Result
Well, not every day is going to be a success. Sadly it seems like my attempt at analytics doesn't work. Maybe I'll sleep on it and it will be clear.

# Plan for Tomorrow
This should be obvious: get analytics working.
