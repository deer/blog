Well, it looks like my newpost feature had a bug, since it doesn't talk to chat gpt and post for me, if I miss a day.

Just kidding, it was doing some nonsense to make the post for the next day, as opposed to the current day. So for example today, it made a template post for the 26th, because the most recent post was the 25th. Obviously that's not right. I've since remedied the situation.

And I've even added a minimal amount of info to the about page, just to start making some progress there.
