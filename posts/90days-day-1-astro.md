Learning about Storybook yesterday was really cool. It got me thinking: what if I were to learn about one technology per day for the next 90 days? I encountered the concept of "tutorial hell", and how it's important to really important to build a personal project instead of just following tutorials.

What if I lean into tutorial hell with purpose? I want to gain a high-level overview of what's going on in web development these days. There are so many technologies floating around, and I really feel so ignorant. I know that following a bunch of getting started guides won't be particularly useful for building something, but I'll at least be able to get my hands dirty.

Or so I thought! I did the [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) getting started tutorial where you build a simple blog and publish it to Netlify. Later on in the day I successfully used Astro to create an internal documentation site at work where I'm trying to establish a "ubiquitous language" (from domain driven design) for our domain. Immediate practical benefit. Cool, right?

Let's see what the next day holds.
