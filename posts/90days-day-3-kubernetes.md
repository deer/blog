Today I spent the first hour of work (sorry boss!) going through some of the Kubernetes tutorials. The [first one](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/hello-minikube/) is an introduction to Minikube, which is a way of runnig K8s locally. Specifically:
> minikube is local Kubernetes, focusing on making it easy to learn and develop for Kubernetes

Great, just what I need. The [second one](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/) is, as the url suggests, a tutorial talking about the basics of Kubernetes. Cool.

I'm not entirely sure how I can apply these concepts right now, but it's great knowing a little bit more about something so important. Deployments -> nodes -> pods -> containers/volumes, or something like that.
